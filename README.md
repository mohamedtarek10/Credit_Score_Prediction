## Introduction

**Overview of the Project

Credit scoring is a crucial task in the financial industry to assess the creditworthiness of individuals. This project aims to develop and evaluate various machine learning models to predict credit scores based on a dataset of customer information.

## Data Preprocessing

**Steps for Preparing the Data**

The data preprocessing steps include:

- **Handling missing values using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation.**
- **Encoding categorical variables using Label Encoding.**
- **Splitting the data into training and test sets.**
- **Applying oversampling to handle class imbalance using SMOTE.**
- **Standardizing the features using StandardScaler.**

## Model Training

**Training Machine Learning Models**

The notebook includes training various machine learning models, including:

- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Neural Network using Keras**

The models are evaluated based on accuracy, and the best-performing model is saved in the `models/` directory.

## Evaluation

**Evaluating Model Performance**

The model evaluation includes:

- **Confusion matrix**
- **Accuracy score**
