Introduction
Overview of the Project

Credit scoring is a crucial task in the financial industry to assess the creditworthiness of individuals. This project aims to develop and evaluate various machine learning models to predict credit scores based on a dataset of customer information.

The data preprocessing steps include:

Handling missing values using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation.
Encoding categorical variables using Label Encoding.
Splitting the data into training and test sets.
Applying oversampling to handle class imbalance using SMOTE.
Standardizing the features using StandardScaler.
Model Training
